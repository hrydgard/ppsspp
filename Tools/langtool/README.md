# Language ini file processor tool

To install Rust and cargo, [go here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

To run, with rust installed, change to this Tools/langtool directory, then:

```bash
cargo run
```

(Or just move the binary out of target/ and run it directly).

To see command line usage, type:

```bash
cargo run -- --help
```

To autoformat the code, use:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

or set up your IDE to do that (it's already pre-set-up for VS Code, if you open the langtool folder directly).
