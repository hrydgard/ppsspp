 * This allows libretro to query in absolute coordinates where on the
 * screen a mouse (or something similar) is being placed.
 * For a touch centric device, coordinates reported are the coordinates
 * of the press.
 *
 * Coordinates in X and Y are reported as:
 * [-0x7fff, 0x7fff]: -0x7fff corresponds to the far left/top of the screen,
 * and 0x7fff corresponds to the far right/bottom of the screen.
 * The "screen" is here defined as area that is passed to the frontend and
 * later displayed on the monitor.
 *
 * The frontend is free to scale/resize this screen as it sees fit, however,
 * (X, Y) = (-0x7fff, -0x7fff) will correspond to the top-left pixel of the
 * game image, etc.
 *
 * To check if the pointer coordinates are valid (e.g. a touch display
 * actually being touched), PRESSED returns 1 or 0.
 *
 * If using a mouse on a desktop, PRESSED will usually correspond to the
 * left mouse button, but this is a frontend decision.
 * PRESSED will only return 1 if the pointer is inside the game screen.
 *
 * For multi-touch, the index variable can be used to successively query
 * more presses.
 * If index = 0 returns true for _PRESSED, coordinates can be extracted
 * with _X, _Y for index = 0. One can then query _PRESSED, _X, _Y with
 * index = 1, and so on.
 * Eventually _PRESSED will return false for an index. No further presses
 * are registered at this point. */
