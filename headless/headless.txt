TODO: This documentation is outdated and needs updating.

This is a build of PPSSPP that does not have graphics, it just starts up the system without a display, prints all debug output (as configured) to the console using printf(), and exits when the emulated binary exits.

Usage:

ppsspp-headless test.elf [-m testdata.cso] [-j] [-l]
  -j : Use the JIT
  -m : Mount ISO on umd:
  -l : Print full log output, instead of just the "emulator printfs"

This is primarily intended to run non-graphical unit tests of the emulation engine, such as
those in https://github.com/hrydgard/pspautotests/ .
