.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes filters, sources, and sinks provided by the
libavfilter library.
.SH "FILTERING INTRODUCTION"
.IX Header "FILTERING INTRODUCTION"
Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.
.PP
In libavfilter, it is possible for filters to have multiple inputs and
multiple outputs.
To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we can
use a complex filter graph. For example, the following one:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        input \-\-> split \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-> overlay \-\-> output
\&                    |                             ^
\&                    |                             |
\&                    +\-\-\-\-\-> crop \-\-> vflip \-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
.Ve
.PP
splits the stream in two streams, sends one stream through the crop filter
and the vflip filter before merging it back with the other stream by
overlaying it on top. You can use the following command to achieve this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i input \-vf "[in] split [T1], [T2] overlay=0:H/2 [out]; [T1] crop=iw:ih/2:0:ih/2, vflip [T2]" output
.Ve
.PP
The result will be that in output the top half of the video is mirrored
onto the bottom half.
.PP
Filters are loaded using the \fI\-vf\fR or \fI\-af\fR option passed to
\&\fBffmpeg\fR or to \fBffplay\fR. Filters in the same linear
chain are separated by commas. In our example, \fIsplit,
overlay\fR are in one linear chain, and \fIcrop, vflip\fR are in
another. The points where the linear chains join are labeled by names
enclosed in square brackets. In our example, that is \fI[T1]\fR and
\&\fI[T2]\fR. The special labels \fI[in]\fR and \fI[out]\fR are the points
where video is input and output.
.PP
Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other
by a colon.
.PP
There exist so-called \fIsource filters\fR that do not have an
audio/video input, and \fIsink filters\fR that will not have audio/video
output.
.SH "GRAPH"
.IX Header "GRAPH"
The \fIgraph2dot\fR program included in the FFmpeg \fItools\fR
directory can be used to parse a filter graph description and issue a
corresponding textual representation in the dot language.
.PP
Invoke the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        graph2dot \-h
.Ve
.PP
to see how to use \fIgraph2dot\fR.
.PP
You can then pass the dot description to the \fIdot\fR program (from
the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation
of the filter graph.
.PP
For example the sequence of commands:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        echo <GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> | \e
\&        tools/graph2dot \-o graph.tmp && \e
\&        dot \-Tpng graph.tmp \-o graph.png && \e
\&        display graph.png
.Ve
.PP
can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
described by the \fI\s-1GRAPH_DESCRIPTION\s0\fR string. Note that this string must be
a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined.
For example if your command line is of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i infile \-vf scale=640:360 outfile
.Ve
.PP
your \fI\s-1GRAPH_DESCRIPTION\s0\fR string will need to be of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink
.Ve
.PP
you may also need to set the \fInullsrc\fR parameters and add a \fIformat\fR
filter in order to simulate a specific input file.
.SH "FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION"
A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of
filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one
filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other
side connecting it to the one filter accepting its output.
.PP
Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
registered in the application, which defines the features and the
number of input and output pads of the filter.
.PP
A filter with no input pads is called a \*(L"source\*(R", a filter with no
output pads is called a \*(L"sink\*(R".
.SS "Filtergraph syntax"
.IX Subsection "Filtergraph syntax"
A filtergraph can be represented using a textual representation, which is
recognized by the \fB\-filter\fR/\fB\-vf\fR and \fB\-filter_complex\fR
options in \fBffmpeg\fR and \fB\-vf\fR in \fBffplay\fR, and by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`avfilter_graph_parse()\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`avfilter_graph_parse2()\*(C'\fR function defined in
\&\fIlibavfilter/avfiltergraph.h\fR.
.PP
A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
represented by a list of \*(L",\*(R"\-separated filter descriptions.
.PP
A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
filterchains is represented by a list of \*(L";\*(R"\-separated filterchain
descriptions.
.PP
A filter is represented by a string of the form:
[\fIin_link_1\fR]...[\fIin_link_N\fR]\fIfilter_name\fR=\fIarguments\fR[\fIout_link_1\fR]...[\fIout_link_M\fR]
.PP
\&\fIfilter_name\fR is the name of the filter class of which the
described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of
the filter classes registered in the program.
The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string
"=\fIarguments\fR".
.PP
\&\fIarguments\fR is a string which contains the parameters used to
initialize the filter instance, and are described in the filter
descriptions below.
.PP
The list of arguments can be quoted using the character \*(L"'\*(R" as initial
and ending mark, and the character '\e' for escaping the characters
within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
\&\*(L"[]=;,\*(R") is encountered.
.PP
The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
followed by a list of link labels.
A link label allows to name a link and associate it to a filter output
or input pad. The preceding labels \fIin_link_1\fR
\&... \fIin_link_N\fR, are associated to the filter input pads,
the following labels \fIout_link_1\fR ... \fIout_link_M\fR, are
associated to the output pads.
.PP
When two link labels with the same name are found in the
filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is
created.
.PP
If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.
For example in the filterchain:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink
.Ve
.PP
the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
\&\*(L"L1\*(R", the first input pad of overlay is labelled \*(L"L2\*(R", and the second
output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay,
which are both unlabelled.
.PP
In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.
.PP
Libavfilter will automatically insert scale filters where format
conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags
for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending
\&\f(CW\*(C`sws_flags=\f(CIflags\f(CW;\*(C'\fR
to the filtergraph description.
.PP
Follows a \s-1BNF\s0 description for the filtergraph syntax:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        <NAME>             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and \*(Aq_\*(Aq
\&        <LINKLABEL>        ::= "[" <NAME> "]"
\&        <LINKLABELS>       ::= <LINKLABEL> [<LINKLABELS>]
\&        <FILTER_ARGUMENTS> ::= sequence of chars (eventually quoted)
\&        <FILTER>           ::= [<LINKLABELS>] <NAME> ["=" <FILTER_ARGUMENTS>] [<LINKLABELS>]
\&        <FILTERCHAIN>      ::= <FILTER> [,<FILTERCHAIN>]
\&        <FILTERGRAPH>      ::= [sws_flags=<flags>;] <FILTERCHAIN> [;<FILTERGRAPH>]
.Ve
.SS "Notes on filtergraph escaping"
.IX Subsection "Notes on filtergraph escaping"
Some filter arguments require the use of special characters, typically
\&\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR to separate key=value pairs in a named options list. In this
case the user should perform a first level escaping when specifying
the filter arguments. For example, consider the following literal
string to be embedded in the drawtext filter arguments:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        this is a \*(Aqstring\*(Aq: may contain one, or more, special characters
.Ve
.PP
Since \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR is special for the filter arguments syntax, it needs to
be escaped, so you get:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        text=this is a \e\*(Aqstring\e\*(Aq\e: may contain one, or more, special characters
.Ve
.PP
A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
arguments in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        drawtext=text=this is a \e\e\e\*(Aqstring\e\e\e\*(Aq\e\e: may contain one\e, or more\e, special characters
.Ve
.PP
Finally an additional level of escaping may be needed when writing the
filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR is special and needs to be escaped with another \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR, the
previous string will finally result in:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-vf "drawtext=text=this is a \e\e\e\e\e\e\*(Aqstring\e\e\e\e\e\e\*(Aq\e\e\e\e: may contain one\e\e, or more\e\e, special characters"
.Ve
.PP
Sometimes, it might be more convenient to employ quoting in place of
escaping. For example the string:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        Caesar: tu quoque, Brute, fili mi
.Ve
.PP
Can be quoted in the filter arguments as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        text=\*(AqCaesar: tu quoque, Brute, fili mi\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
And finally inserted in a filtergraph like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        drawtext=text=\e\*(AqCaesar: tu quoque\e, Brute\e, fili mi\e\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
See the ``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual
for more information about the escaping and quoting rules adopted by
FFmpeg.
.SH "AUDIO FILTERS"
.IX Header "AUDIO FILTERS"
When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-filters\*(C'\fR.
The configure output will show the audio filters included in your
build.
.PP
Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.
.SS "aconvert"

Convert the input audio format to the specified formats.
.PP
The filter accepts a string of the form:
"\fIsample_format\fR:\fIchannel_layout\fR".
.PP
\&\fIsample_format\fR specifies the sample format, and can be a string or the
corresponding numeric value defined in \fIlibavutil/samplefmt.h\fR. Use 'p'
suffix for a planar sample format.
.PP
\&\fIchannel_layout\fR specifies the channel layout, and can be a string

Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.
.PP
The filter accepts the following named options:
.IP "\fBinputs\fR" 4
.IX Item "inputs"
Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.
.PP
If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible,
the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels
will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all
the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of
the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of
channels.
.PP
For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (\s-1FL+FR+LF\s0) and the second input
is \s-1FC+BL+BR\s0, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).
.PP
On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be
in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.
.PP
All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by
dropping the extra channels:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        pan="stereo: c0=FL : c1=FR"

Assume the first pts should be this value. The time base is 1 / sample rate.
This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no
assumption is made about the first frame's expected pts, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative pts due to encoder delay.

.SS "channelmap"
.IX Subsection "channelmap"
Remap input channels to new locations.
.PP
This filter accepts the following named parameters:
.IP "\fBchannel_layout\fR" 4
.IX Item "channel_layout"
Channel layout of the output stream.
.IP "\fBmap\fR" 4
.IX Item "map"
Map channels from input to output. The argument is a comma-separated list of
mappings, each in the \f(CW\*(C`\f(CIin_channel\f(CW\-\f(CIout_channel\f(CW\*(C'\fR or
\&\fIin_channel\fR form. \fIin_channel\fR can be either the name of the input
channel (e.g. \s-1FL\s0 for front left) or its index in the input channel layout.
\&\fIout_channel\fR is the name of the output channel or its index in the output
channel layout. If \fIout_channel\fR is not given then it is implicitly an
index, starting with zero and increasing by one for each mapping.
.PP
If no mapping is present, the filter will implicitly map input channels to
output channels preserving index.
.PP
For example, assuming a 5.1+downmix input \s-1MOV\s0 file
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.mov \-filter \*(Aqchannelmap=map=DL\-FL\e,DR\-FR\*(Aq out.wav

.SS "join"
.IX Subsection "join"
Join multiple input streams into one multi-channel stream.
.PP
The filter accepts the following named parameters:
.IP "\fBinputs\fR" 4
.IX Item "inputs"
Number of input streams. Defaults to 2.
.IP "\fBchannel_layout\fR" 4
.IX Item "channel_layout"
Desired output channel layout. Defaults to stereo.
.IP "\fBmap\fR" 4
.IX Item "map"
Map channels from inputs to output. The argument is a comma-separated list of
mappings, each in the \f(CW\*(C`\f(CIinput_idx\f(CW.\f(CIin_channel\f(CW\-\f(CIout_channel\f(CW\*(C'\fR
form. \fIinput_idx\fR is the 0\-based index of the input stream. \fIin_channel\fR
can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. \s-1FL\s0 for front left) or its
index in the specified input stream. \fIout_channel\fR is the name of the output
channel.
.PP
The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when those are not specified
explicitly. It does so by first trying to find an unused matching input channel
and if that fails it picks the first unused input channel.
.PP
E.g. to join 3 inputs (with properly set channel layouts)
.PP
.Vb 1

.SS "volumedetect"
.IX Subsection "volumedetect"
Detect the volume of the input video.
.PP
The filter has no parameters. The input is not modified. Statistics about
the volume will be printed in the log when the input stream end is reached.
.PP
In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum
volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of an histogram of the
registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of
the samples).
.PP

\&        [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409
.Ve
.PP
It means that:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The mean square energy is approximately \-27 dB, or 10^\-2.7.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The largest sample is at \-4 dB, or more precisely between \-4 dB and \-5 dB.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There are 6 samples at \-4 dB, 62 at \-5 dB, 286 at \-6 dB, etc.
.PP
In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping,
raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.

Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter chain.
.PP
This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in \fIlibavfilter/buffersink.h\fR.
.PP
It requires a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which
defines the incoming buffers' formats, to be passed as the opaque
parameter to \f(CW\*(C`avfilter_init_filter\*(C'\fR for initialization.
.SS "anullsink"
.IX Subsection "anullsink"
Null audio sink, do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is
mainly useful as a template and to be employed in analysis / debugging

This sink is intended for programmatic use. Frames that arrive on this sink can
be retrieved by the calling program using the interface defined in
\&\fIlibavfilter/buffersink.h\fR.
.PP
This filter accepts no parameters.
.SH "VIDEO FILTERS"
.IX Header "VIDEO FILTERS"
When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-filters\*(C'\fR.
The configure output will show the video filters included in your
build.
.PP
Below is a description of the currently available video filters.
.SS "alphaextract"
.IX Subsection "alphaextract"
Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This
is especially useful with the \fIalphamerge\fR filter.
.SS "alphamerge"
.IX Subsection "alphamerge"
Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
\&\fIalphaextract\fR to allow the transmission or storage of frame
sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn't support an alpha
channel.
.PP
For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
and a separate video created with \fIalphaextract\fR, you might use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]
.Ve
.PP
Since this filter is designed for reconstruction, it operates on frame
sequences without considering timestamps, and terminates when either
input reaches end of stream. This will cause problems if your encoding
pipeline drops frames. If you're trying to apply an image as an
overlay to a video stream, consider the \fIoverlay\fR filter instead.
.SS "ass"
.IX Subsection "ass"
Same as the subtitles filter, except that it doesn't require libavcodec
and libavformat to work. On the other hand, it is limited to \s-1ASS\s0 (Advanced
Substation Alpha) subtitles files.
.SS "bbox"
.IX Subsection "bbox"
Compute the bounding box for the non-black pixels in the input frame
luminance plane.
.PP
This filter computes the bounding box containing all the pixels with a
luminance value greater than the minimum allowed value.
The parameters describing the bounding box are printed on the filter
log.
.SS "blackdetect"
.IX Subsection "blackdetect"
Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be
useful to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid
recordings. Output lines contains the time for the start, end and
duration of the detected black interval expressed in seconds.
.PP
In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
least to the \s-1AV_LOG_INFO\s0 value.
.PP
This filter accepts a list of options in the form of

accepted options follows.
.IP "\fBblack_min_duration, d\fR" 4
.IX Item "black_min_duration, d"

Default value is 0.98.
.IP "\fBpixel_black_th, pix_th\fR" 4
.IX Item "pixel_black_th, pix_th"
Set the threshold for considering a pixel \*(L"black\*(R".
.Sp
The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luminance value for which a
pixel is considered \*(L"black\*(R". The provided value is scaled according to
the following equation:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        <absolute_threshold> = <luminance_minimum_value> + <pixel_black_th> * <luminance_range_size>
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fIluminance_range_size\fR and \fIluminance_minimum_value\fR depend on
the input video format, the range is [0\-255] for \s-1YUV\s0 full-range
formats and [16\-235] for \s-1YUV\s0 non full-range formats.
.Sp
Default value is 0.10.
.PP
The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum
value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00
.Ve
.SS "blackframe"
.IX Subsection "blackframe"
Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to
detect chapter transitions or commercials. Output lines consist of
the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness,
the position in the file if known or \-1 and the timestamp in seconds.
.PP
In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
least to the \s-1AV_LOG_INFO\s0 value.
.PP
The filter accepts the syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1

.IX Item "max_glyph_a, ascent"
the maximum distance from the baseline to the highest/upper grid
coordinate used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered
glyphs.
It is a positive value, due to the grid's orientation with the Y axis
upwards.
.IP "\fBmax_glyph_d, descent\fR" 4
.IX Item "max_glyph_d, descent"
the maximum distance from the baseline to the lowest grid coordinate
used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered glyphs.

.IX Item "x, y"
the x and y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.
.Sp
These parameters allow the \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR expressions to refer
each other, so you can for example specify \f(CW\*(C`y=x/dar\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If libavfilter was built with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-fontconfig\*(C'\fR, then
\&\fBfontfile\fR can be a fontconfig pattern or omitted.
.PP
\fIText expansion\fR
.IX Subsection "Text expansion"
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR,
the filter recognizes \fIstrftime()\fR sequences in the provided text and
expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of \fIstrftime()\fR. This
feature is deprecated.
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, the text is printed verbatim.
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`normal\*(C'\fR (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.
.PP
The backslash character '\e', followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.
.PP
Sequence of the form \f(CW\*(C`%{...}\*(C'\fR are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ':'.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':' or '}'),
they should be escaped.
.PP
Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the
\&\fBtext\fR option in the filter argument string and as the filter
argument in the filter graph description, and possibly also for the shell,
that makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file avoids these
problems.
.PP
The following functions are available:
.IP "\fBexpr, e\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr, e"
The expression evaluation result.
.Sp
It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated,
which accepts the same constants and functions as the \fIx\fR and
\&\fIy\fR values. Note that not all constants should be used, for
example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
the constants \fItext_w\fR and \fItext_h\fR will have an undefined
value.
.IP "\fBgmtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "gmtime"
The time at which the filter is running, expressed in \s-1UTC\s0.
It can accept an argument: a \fIstrftime()\fR format string.
.IP "\fBlocaltime\fR" 4
.IX Item "localtime"

.SS "field"
.IX Subsection "field"
Extract a single field from an interlaced image using stride
arithmetic to avoid wasting \s-1CPU\s0 time. The output frames are marked as
non-interlaced.
.PP
This filter accepts the following named options:
.IP "\fBtype\fR" 4
.IX Item "type"
Specify whether to extract the top (if the value is \f(CW0\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`top\*(C'\fR) or the bottom field (if the value is \f(CW1\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`bottom\*(C'\fR).
.PP
If the option key is not specified, the first value sets the \fItype\fR
option. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        field=bottom
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        field=type=bottom
.Ve
.SS "fieldorder"
.IX Subsection "fieldorder"
Transform the field order of the input video.
.PP
It accepts one parameter which specifies the required field order that
the input interlaced video will be transformed to. The parameter can
assume one of the following values:
.IP "\fB0 or bff\fR" 4
.IX Item "0 or bff"
output bottom field first
.IP "\fB1 or tff\fR" 4
.IX Item "1 or tff"
output top field first
.PP
Default value is \*(L"tff\*(R".
.PP
Transformation is achieved by shifting the picture content up or down
by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content.
This method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.
.PP
If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
flagged as being of the required output field order then this filter does
not alter the incoming video.
.PP
This filter is very useful when converting to or from \s-1PAL\s0 \s-1DV\s0 material,
which is bottom field first.

.PP
It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
intensities.  The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to
equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
viewed as an \*(L"automatically adjusting contrast filter\*(R". This filter is
useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source
video.
.PP
The filter accepts parameters as a list of \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR
pairs, separated by \*(L":\*(R". If the key of the first options is omitted,
the arguments are interpreted according to syntax
\&\fIstrength\fR:\fIintensity\fR:\fIantibanding\fR.
.PP
This filter accepts the following named options:
.IP "\fBstrength\fR" 4
.IX Item "strength"
Determine the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the strength
is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more
approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number
in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.
.IP "\fBintensity\fR" 4
.IX Item "intensity"
Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output
values appropriately.  The strength should be set as desired and then
the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value
must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.
.IP "\fBantibanding\fR" 4
.IX Item "antibanding"
Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary
the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of
the histogram. Possible values are \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`weak\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`strong\*(C'\fR. It defaults to \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR.
.SS "histogram"
.IX Subsection "histogram"
Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.
.PP
The computed histogram is a representation of distribution of color components
in an image.
.PP
The filter accepts the following named parameters:
.IP "\fBmode\fR" 4
.IX Item "mode"
Set histogram mode.
.Sp
It accepts the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBlevels\fR" 4
.IX Item "levels"
standard histogram that display color components distribution in an image.
Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution
of the Y, U, V, A or G, B, R components, depending on input format,
in current frame. Bellow each graph is color component scale meter.
.IP "\fBcolor\fR" 4
.IX Item "color"
chroma values in vectorscope, if brighter more such chroma values are
distributed in an image.
Displays chroma values (U/V color placement) in two dimensional graph
(which is called a vectorscope). It can be used to read of the hue and
saturation of the current frame. At a same time it is a histogram.
The whiter a pixel in the vectorscope, the more pixels of the input frame
correspond to that pixel (that is the more pixels have this chroma value).
The V component is displayed on the horizontal (X) axis, with the leftmost
side being V = 0 and the rightmost side being V = 255.
The U component is displayed on the vertical (Y) axis, with the top
representing U = 0 and the bottom representing U = 255.
.Sp
The position of a white pixel in the graph corresponds to the chroma value
of a pixel of the input clip. So the graph can be used to read of the
hue (color flavor) and the saturation (the dominance of the hue in the color).
As the hue of a color changes, it moves around the square. At the center of
the square, the saturation is zero, which means that the corresponding pixel
has no color. If you increase the amount of a specific color, while leaving
the other colors unchanged, the saturation increases, and you move towards
the edge of the square.
.IP "\fBcolor2\fR" 4
.IX Item "color2"

Default value is \f(CW10\fR. Allowed range is [1, 255].
.IP "\fBwaveform_mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "waveform_mode"

.IP "\fBdisplay_mode\fR" 4

.RS 4
.IP "\fBparade\fR" 4
.IX Item "parade"
Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
\&\f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR waveform mode or one below other in \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR waveform mode
for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode. For \f(CW\*(C`levels\*(C'\fR histogram mode
per color component graphs are placed one bellow other.
.Sp
This display mode in \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode makes it easy to spot
color casts in the highlights and shadows of an image, by comparing the
contours of the top and the bottom of each waveform.
Since whites, grays, and blacks are characterized by
exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, neutral areas of the
picture should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height.
If not, the correction is easy to make by making adjustments to level the
three waveforms.
.IP "\fBoverlay\fR" 4
.IX Item "overlay"
Presents information that's identical to that in the \f(CW\*(C`parade\*(C'\fR, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

This display mode in \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode can make it easier to spot

.PP
It accepts the parameters: \fIstruct_el\fR:\fInb_iterations\fR.
.PP
\&\fIstruct_el\fR represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
\&\fIcols\fRx\fIrows\fR+\fIanchor_x\fRx\fIanchor_y\fR/\fIshape\fR

point, and \fIshape\fR the shape for the structuring element, and
can be one of the values \*(L"rect\*(R", \*(L"cross\*(R", \*(L"ellipse\*(R", \*(L"custom\*(R".
.PP
If the value for \fIshape\fR is \*(L"custom\*(R", it must be followed by a
string of the form "=\fIfilename\fR". The file with name
\&\fIfilename\fR is assumed to represent a binary image, with each
printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom
\&\fIshape\fR is used, \fIcols\fR and \fIrows\fR are ignored, the number

.SS "removelogo"
.IX Subsection "removelogo"
Suppress a \s-1TV\s0 station logo, using an image file to determine which
pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that
comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.
.PP
This filter requires one argument which specifies the filter bitmap
file, which can be any image format supported by libavformat. The
width and height of the image file must match those of the video
stream being processed.
.PP
Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.
.PP
If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.
.SS "scale"
.IX Subsection "scale"
Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale library.

two options is not specified, the assumed keys for the first two
values are \f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR. If the first option has no key and

.SS "setdar, setsar"
.IX Subsection "setdar, setsar"
The \f(CW\*(C`setdar\*(C'\fR filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter

This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect
Ratio, according to the following equation:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <DAR> = <HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION> / <VERTICAL_RESOLUTION> * <SAR>
.Ve
.PP
Keep in mind that the \f(CW\*(C`setdar\*(C'\fR filter does not modify the pixel
dimensions of the video frame. Also the display aspect ratio set by
this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain,
e.g. in case of scaling or if another \*(L"setdar\*(R" or a \*(L"setsar\*(R" filter is
applied.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`setsar\*(C'\fR filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for
the filter output video.
.PP
Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the
output display aspect ratio will change according to the equation
above.
.PP
Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the \f(CW\*(C`setsar\*(C'\fR
filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if
another \*(L"setsar\*(R" or a \*(L"setdar\*(R" filter is applied.

the parameter is not specified, it is assumed the value \*(L"0\*(R".
In case the form "\fInum\fR:\fIden\fR" the \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR character should

Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be specified.
.IP "\fBoriginal_size\fR" 4
.IX Item "original_size"
Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the \s-1ASS\s0 file
was composed. Due to a misdesign in \s-1ASS\s0 aspect ratio arithmetic, this is
necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio has been changed.
.IP "\fBcharenc\fR" 4
.IX Item "charenc"
Set subtitles input character encoding. \f(CW\*(C`subtitles\*(C'\fR filter only. Only
useful if not \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.PP
If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value
specifies the \fBfilename\fR.
.PP
For example, to render the file \fIsub.srt\fR on top of the input
video, use the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        subtitles=sub.srt
.Ve
.PP
which is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        subtitles=filename=sub.srt
.Ve
.SS "split"
.IX Subsection "split"
Split input video into several identical outputs.
.PP
The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of outputs. If
unspecified, it defaults to 2.
.PP
For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-filter_complex split=5 OUTPUT
.Ve
.PP
will create 5 copies of the input video.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        [in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
\&        [splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
\&        [splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];
.Ve
.PP
will create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and
one padded.
.SS "super2xsai"
.IX Subsection "super2xsai"
Scale the input by 2x and smooth using the Super2xSaI (Scale and
Interpolate) pixel art scaling algorithm.
.PP
Useful for enlarging pixel art images without reducing sharpness.
.SS "swapuv"
.IX Subsection "swapuv"
Swap U & V plane.
.SS "thumbnail"
.IX Subsection "thumbnail"
Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of consecutive frames.
.PP
It accepts as argument the frames batch size to analyze (default \fIN\fR=100);
in a set of \fIN\fR frames, the filter will pick one of them, and then handle
the next batch of \fIN\fR frames until the end.
.PP
Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a bigger \fIN\fR
value will result in a higher memory usage, so a high value is not recommended.
.PP
The following example extract one picture each 50 frames:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        thumbnail=50
.Ve
.PP
Complete example of a thumbnail creation with \fBffmpeg\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-vf thumbnail,scale=300:200 \-frames:v 1 out.png
.Ve
.SS "tile"
.IX Subsection "tile"
Tile several successive frames together.
.PP
It accepts a list of options in the form of \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs
separated by \*(L":\*(R". A description of the accepted options follows.
.IP "\fBlayout\fR" 4
.IX Item "layout"
Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns) in the form
"\fIw\fRx\fIh\fR".
.IP "\fBmargin\fR" 4
.IX Item "margin"
Set the outer border margin in pixels.
.IP "\fBpadding\fR" 4
.IX Item "padding"
Set the inner border thickness (i.e. the number of pixels between frames). For
more advanced padding options (such as having different values for the edges),
refer to the pad video filter.
.IP "\fBnb_frames\fR" 4
.IX Item "nb_frames"
Set the maximum number of frames to render in the given area. It must be less
than or equal to \fIw\fRx\fIh\fR. The default value is \f(CW0\fR, meaning all
the area will be used.
.PP
Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
.PP
\&\fIlayout\fR[:\fInb_frames\fR[:\fImargin\fR[:\fIpadding\fR]]]
.PP
For example, produce 8x8 \s-1PNG\s0 tiles of all keyframes (\fB\-skip_frame
nokey\fR) in a movie:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-skip_frame nokey \-i file.avi \-vf \*(Aqscale=128:72,tile=8x8\*(Aq \-an \-vsync 0 keyframes%03d.png
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-vsync 0\fR is necessary to prevent \fBffmpeg\fR from
duplicating each output frame to accomodate the originally detected frame
rate.
.PP
Another example to display \f(CW5\fR pictures in an area of \f(CW\*(C`3x2\*(C'\fR frames,
with \f(CW7\fR pixels between them, and \f(CW2\fR pixels of initial margin, using
mixed flat and named options:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        tile=3x2:nb_frames=5:padding=7:margin=2
.Ve
.SS "tinterlace"
.IX Subsection "tinterlace"
Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.
.PP
Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is
considered odd.
.PP
This filter accepts options in the form of \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs
separated by \*(L":\*(R".
Alternatively, the \fImode\fR option can be specified as a value alone,
optionally followed by a \*(L":\*(R" and further \*(L":\*(R" separated \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR
pairs.
.PP

This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in \fIlibavfilter/vsrc_buffer.h\fR.
.PP
It accepts a list of options in the form of \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs
separated by \*(L":\*(R". A description of the accepted options follows.
.IP "\fBvideo_size\fR" 4
.IX Item "video_size"
Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames.
.IP "\fBpix_fmt\fR" 4
.IX Item "pix_fmt"
A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format
name.
.IP "\fBtime_base\fR" 4
.IX Item "time_base"
Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered frames.
.IP "\fBtime_base\fR" 4
.IX Item "time_base"

will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
with format \*(L"yuv410p\*(R", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).
Since the pixel format with name \*(L"yuv410p\*(R" corresponds to the number 6
(check the enum AVPixelFormat definition in \fIlibavutil/pixfmt.h\fR),
this example corresponds to:
.PP
.Vb 1

.SS "frei0r_src"
.IX Subsection "frei0r_src"
Provide a frei0r source.
.PP
To enable compilation of this filter you need to install the frei0r
header and configure FFmpeg with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-frei0r\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The source supports the syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <size>:<rate>:<src_name>[{=|:}<param1>:<param2>:...:<paramN>]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIsize\fR is the size of the video to generate, may be a string of the
form \fIwidth\fRx\fIheight\fR or a frame size abbreviation.
\&\fIrate\fR is the rate of the video to generate, may be a string of
the form \fInum\fR/\fIden\fR or a frame rate abbreviation.
\&\fIsrc_name\fR is the name to the frei0r source to load. For more
information regarding frei0r and how to set the parameters read the

.Ve
.SS "life"
.IX Subsection "life"
Generate a life pattern.
.PP
This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.
.PP
The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
.PP
At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The \fBrule\fR option allows to specify
the rule to adopt.
.PP
This source accepts a list of options in the form of
\&\fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs separated by \*(L":\*(R". A description of the
accepted options follows.
.IP "\fBfilename, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename, f"
Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline
is used to delimit the end of each row.
.Sp
If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
randomly.
.IP "\fBrate, r\fR" 4
.IX Item "rate, r"
Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.
.IP "\fBrandom_fill_ratio, ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "random_fill_ratio, ratio"
Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
It is ignored when a file is specified.
.IP "\fBrandom_seed, seed\fR" 4
.IX Item "random_seed, seed"
Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and \s-1UINT32_MAX\s0. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to \-1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.
.IP "\fBrule\fR" 4
.IX Item "rule"
Set the life rule.
.Sp
A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "S\fI\s-1NS\s0\fR/B\fI\s-1NB\s0\fR",
where \fI\s-1NS\s0\fR and \fI\s-1NB\s0\fR are sequences of numbers in the range 0\-8,
\&\fI\s-1NS\s0\fR specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and \fI\s-1NB\s0\fR the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to \*(L"born\*(R").
\&\*(L"s\*(R" and \*(L"b\*(R" can be used in place of \*(L"S\*(R" and \*(L"B\*(R", respectively.
.Sp
Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18\-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for \*(L"borning\*(R" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = \f(CW\*(C`(12<<9)+9\*(C'\fR specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to \*(L"S23/B03\*(R".
.Sp
Default value is \*(L"S23/B3\*(R", which is the original Conway's game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.
.IP "\fBsize, s\fR" 4
.IX Item "size, s"
Set the size of the output video.
.Sp
If \fBfilename\fR is specified, the size is set by default to the
same size of the input file. If \fBsize\fR is set, it must contain
the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in
that file is centered in the larger resulting area.
.Sp
If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to \*(L"320x240\*(R"
(used for a randomly generated initial grid).
.IP "\fBstitch\fR" 4
.IX Item "stitch"
If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.
.IP "\fBmold\fR" 4
.IX Item "mold"
Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from \fBdeath_color\fR to
\&\fBmold_color\fR with a step of \fBmold\fR. \fBmold\fR can have a
value from 0 to 255.
.IP "\fBlife_color\fR" 4
.IX Item "life_color"
Set the color of living (or new born) cells.
.IP "\fBdeath_color\fR" 4
.IX Item "death_color"
Set the color of dead cells. If \fBmold\fR is set, this is the first color
used to represent a dead cell.
.IP "\fBmold_color\fR" 4
.IX Item "mold_color"
Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

\fICommands syntax\fR
.IX Subsection "Commands syntax"
.PP
A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a
particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event
is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time
interval.
.PP
An interval is specified by the following syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <START>[\-<END>] <COMMANDS>;
.Ve
.PP
The time interval is specified by the \fI\s-1START\s0\fR and \fI\s-1END\s0\fR times.
\&\fI\s-1END\s0\fR is optional and defaults to the maximum time.
.PP
The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if
it is included in the interval [\fI\s-1START\s0\fR, \fI\s-1END\s0\fR), that is when
the time is greater or equal to \fI\s-1START\s0\fR and is lesser than
\&\fI\s-1END\s0\fR.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1COMMANDS\s0\fR consists of a sequence of one or more command
specifications, separated by \*(L",\*(R", relating to that interval.  The
syntax of a command specification is given by:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [<FLAGS>] <TARGET> <COMMAND> <ARG>
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1FLAGS\s0\fR is optional and specifies the type of events relating to
the time interval which enable sending the specified command, and must
be a non-null sequence of identifier flags separated by \*(L"+\*(R" or \*(L"|\*(R" and
enclosed between \*(L"[\*(R" and \*(L"]\*(R".
.PP
The following flags are recognized:
.IP "\fBenter\fR" 4
.IX Item "enter"
The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the
current is.
.IP "\fBleave\fR" 4
.IX Item "leave"
The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the
current is not.
.PP
If \fI\s-1FLAGS\s0\fR is not specified, a default value of \f(CW\*(C`[enter]\*(C'\fR is
assumed.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1TARGET\s0\fR specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR specifies the name of the command for the target filter.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1ARG\s0\fR is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for
the given \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR.
.PP
Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or
sequences of characters starting with \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR until the end of line,
are ignored and can be used to annotate comments.

\&\s-1EBU\s0 R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream as input and outputs
it unchanged. By default, it logs a message at a frequency of 10Hz with the
Momentary loudness (identified by \f(CW\*(C`M\*(C'\fR), Short-term loudness (\f(CW\*(C`S\*(C'\fR),
Integrated loudness (\f(CW\*(C`I\*(C'\fR) and Loudness Range (\f(CW\*(C`LRA\*(C'\fR).

The filter also has a video output (see the \fIvideo\fR option) with a real
time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the logged
message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set,
unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area contains the
short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the gauge on the right is for
the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds).
.PP

.SS "concat"
.IX Subsection "concat"
Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the
other.
.PP
The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All
segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will
also be the number of streams at output.
.PP
The filter accepts the following named parameters:
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
Set the number of segments. Default is 2.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of video
streams in each segment. Default is 1.
.IP "\fBa\fR" 4
.IX Item "a"
Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of video
streams in each segment. Default is 0.
.IP "\fBunsafe\fR" 4
.IX Item "unsafe"
Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different format.
.PP
The filter has \fIv\fR+\fIa\fR outputs: first \fIv\fR video outputs, then
\&\fIa\fR audio outputs.
.PP
There are \fIn\fRx(\fIv\fR+\fIa\fR) inputs: first the inputs for the first
segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second
segment, etc.
.PP
Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest
stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter
audio streams with silence.
.PP
For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.
.PP
All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the
filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video
streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for
audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted
explicitly by the user.
.PP
Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate
at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.

This is the same as movie source, except it selects an audio
stream by default.
.SS "movie"
.IX Subsection "movie"
Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.
.PP
It accepts the syntax: \fImovie_name\fR[:\fIoptions\fR] where
\&\fImovie_name\fR is the name of the resource to read (not necessarily
a file but also a device or a stream accessed through some protocol),
and \fIoptions\fR is an optional sequence of \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR
pairs, separated by \*(L":\*(R".
.PP
The description of the accepted options follows.
.IP "\fBformat_name, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "format_name, f"
Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either
the name of a container or an input device. If not specified the
format is guessed from \fImovie_name\fR or by probing.
.IP "\fBseek_point, sp\fR" 4
.IX Item "seek_point, sp"
Specifies the seek point in seconds, the frames will be output
starting from this seek point, the parameter is evaluated with
\&\f(CW\*(C`av_strtod\*(C'\fR so the numerical value may be suffixed by an \s-1IS\s0
postfix. Default value is \*(L"0\*(R".
.IP "\fBstreams, s\fR" 4
.IX Item "streams, s"
Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
separated by \*(L"+\*(R". The source will then have as many outputs, in the
same order. The syntax is explained in the ``Stream specifiers''
section in the ffmpeg manual. Two special names, \*(L"dv\*(R" and \*(L"da\*(R" specify
respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default
is \*(L"dv\*(R", or \*(L"da\*(R" if the filter is called as \*(L"amovie\*(R".
.IP "\fBstream_index, si\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_index, si"
Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is \-1,
the best suited video stream will be automatically selected. Default
value is \*(L"\-1\*(R". Deprecated. If the filter is called \*(L"amovie\*(R", it will select
audio instead of video.
.IP "\fBloop\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop"
Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.
If the value is less than 1, the stream will be read again and again.
Default value is \*(L"1\*(R".
.Sp
Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not
changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.
